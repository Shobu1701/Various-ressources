"In Whist, it's usual to lead trumps if you have 5 or more; otherwise the lowest card of your longest suit first. In Schafkopf, you lead trumps if you are the declarer or partner, either lowest or highest depending on your trump holding; if you lead low, you're hoping for your partner to take the trick and lead low back, etc."

"the major danger in starting with a low trump is that it gives your opponents the chance to finesse 
so you may want to start with a middling one in order to force out the Ace or whatever"

"it's typical to start with losing tricks as long as you still have winners in other suits"

"If you mean in a plain trick game (assuming true from the channel), I think the convention is to try to draw trumps so that you have the lead when the bad guys are out of trumps. So if you know you have a good break, where you have more trumps than the longest opponent, you may lead from the top. If you have equal trumps, you may well draw trumps using your lowest trumps (which will make  the draw slower, because you're going to lose your lead), because you want the last trump trick to be won by your ace.

In point trick games,  especially games like skat/schafkopf where the highest point trumps aren't your most powerful, the rules are more subtle."
